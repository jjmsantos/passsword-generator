# Password Generator

***

JavaScript file was edited and made with some minor start code included.
* Pseudo Code can be found at the top of the JS page to help me map out where to start, and how to tackle the problem at hand.
* I then created a `generatePassword` function that occurs as soon as the button on the HTML page is clicked.
* First prompt goes into the `genLength` string which will determine the length of the password.
* 4 confirm windows will follow to determine the parameters needs to generate the password.
* Once user chooses parameters, go through a for loop, and generate password depending on the users requested length.
